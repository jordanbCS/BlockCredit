 - "There are couple of interesting projects in this space. Bloom is working on staking based credit scoring and expects to integrate input from existing credit bureaus into their scoring framework in future releases. Colendi is blockchain based credit scoring project, which utilizes alternative data inputs such as utility bill payment, retail spending and more. Cerved, an Italian credit scoring agency, is also interested in applying open data protocols enabled by PSD2 to enable a more transparent credit scoring process. For those projects and others exploring credit, we invite them to build on the Enigma protocol. Letâ€™s create a better, more secure, more decentralized future together!"
